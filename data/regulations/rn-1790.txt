 II. There being Reafon to believe , that, in Times of Man without Preffing, the Captains of some of His Majesty's ships have taken an unjustifiable Liberty of discharging Men whom they did not like , or fending them on shore in their Boats, thereby giving them an Opportunity of deferting; every Commander of His Majesty's ships and Vessels is hereby ftrictly charged and required (when a Prefs shall be on Foot) not to presume to difcharge any Man, on any Account whatsoever, without an Order from this Board, or a Flag Officer ; and to Not to give avoid giving Opportunities for Desertion , he is as Opportunities ftrictly charged never to fend or employ any Men on forDefertion. shore (if it can poffibly be avoided) or fend any in Merchant ships in Lieu of Preft Men, or to give Leave of Abfence to any, unless they are Truft-worthy, and may be depended upon for their Return ; but to take Care to keep them ftrictly to their Duty, unlefs there shall be an abfolute Neceffity, by Reason of sickness, to fend them to Hofpitals for Cure ; and, in that Cafe, to take as much Care as poffible may be, that they be sent on shore in such Manner, + as ( 193 ) as not to give them Opportunity to defert, and that they be brought on Board again as soon as recovered of their sickness
 . :
 III. except such as There being great Reason to believe that it is a No sick to be frequent Practice for Commanders of His Majesty's Jenton shore ships to fend Men to Hospitals or sick Quarters for cannotbe taken due flight Ailments or Hurts, which might very well be Care ofon taken Care of and cured on Board the ships to which Board. they belong And whereas such Proceeding is not only burthensome to the Public, by occafioning a great additional Expence while the Men are under Cure, but is attended with a ftill much worfe Confequence to the service, by the Loss of many Men, who make use of the Opportunity thereby afforded them to defert : For Remedy of thefe Evils, every Commander of His Majesty's ships and Vessels is hereby ftrictly enjoined never to fend any Men to an Hospital or sick Quarters, unless their Diftempers or Hurts are such, or the Number of sick and Hurt fo great, that they cannot be taken due Care of on Board, which the surgeon of the ship is to certify, under his Hand, before any Man whatever is fent to such Hospital or Quarters : And in Order to a due Obfervance hereof, we do farther direct, that when any Men are sent sick on shore, the Physician and surgeon of the Hofpital do forthwith examine them; and if they find any who might have been taken due Care of, and probably cured in a little Time on Board their ships, and therefore ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing ( 194 ) To fend Ac- counts monthly, and on a Cruize, to aforegoing Injunction , to have been fent on shore, they are to certify the fame to the Commanding Officer at the Port, who is immediately to cause them to be returned to their ships, and to tranfmit the Certificate from the Phyfician and surgeon to the Navy-Board, who are thereupon to cause Twenty shillings for each Man fo improperly fent on shore, to be charged against the Wages of the surgeon of the ship from which they were fent, and to be abated therefrom. And whenever the Hofpitals or sick Quarters are visited by a commissioner for sick and Hurt, who is a Physician or surgeon, if he finds any Perfons entertained therein , who ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing Regulation, to have been received , the commissioners for sick and Hurt are to cause the surgeon and the Agent at the Hofpital or sick Quarters to be mulcted Twenty shillings each for every Man fo entertained. "
 IV. He is ftrictly enjoined punctually to comply with the latter Part of the Eighteenth Article of the GeReturn from neral printed Inftructions, directing, (if the ship is in the Admiral Great Britain or Ireland) a Monthly Account of Men, discharged, difcharged to be fent to the Admiralty Office ; and, deferted, and in Addition thereto, he is, whenever the ship puts ty, of Men dead. into any Port of Great Britain or Ireland from a Cruize, to fend a like Account of Men discharged, between the Time the laft Account ended, and the Time of fo putting into Port. He is also strictly to comply ( 195 ) t comply with the sixteenth Article of the said Inftructions, by fending constant Accounts to the secretary of the Admiralty, of Men who defert, at the Times such Desertions happen ; and, moreover, whenever he fends an Account of Men discharged as above directed , he is ftrictly enjoined to tranfmit an Account of Men who have deferted within the fame Period of Time that the Account of discharged Men includes, and to note against them the feveral Particulars prefcribed in the Fifteenth Article of the said Inftructions. He is also further ftrictly directed , when he fends the aforementioned Accounts to tranfmit with them a third Account, containing the Names and Qualities of all the Men who have died within the fame Periods of Time : And if he shall have supernumeraries on Board, he is to distinguish in each Account which of the Men were Part of his Complement, and which were supernumeraries.
 V. Great Inconvenience having arifen to the service , and To make out a Ticketfor also great Difcouragement to scamen ferving in His Ma- every Man jefty's ships, from Captains sometimes discharging Men discharged. without Tickets, every Commander is hereby enjoined to a very strict and punctual Compliance with the seventeenth Article of the General printed Inftructions, (under the Head of the Captain or Commander) in relation to making out Tickets for every Perfon who shall be difcharged ; and, if the Party shall be dead or absent, the Commander is strictly charged to tranfmit his ( 196 ) Pay Lifts to be made out one ship to his Ticket immediately, or by the very first Opportunity, to the Navy- Board. And whenever any Ticket is made out, he is ftrictly charged to fee that all Deductions, of any Kind whatsoever, that ought to be made from the Wages of the Party, be carefully fet off, upon Pain of making good the Value of any Failure therein.
 VI. When any Men borne for Wages shall be diffor Mien dif- charged from one ship or Vessel to another, the Capchargedfrom tain of the ship or Vessel from which they shall be discharged, is to be particularly careful to fend immediately to the Navy-Board proper Pay- Lifts for such Men, in order that they may be paid the Wages due to them as soon as poffible after their being so discharged. another. Particular to Agent for sick and fent on shore.
 VII. Whereas it generally happens, that when any of Ticketstobe His Majesty's ships proceed to sea, they leave Men at an Hospital or sick Quarters, and some of those Hurt, with Men are afterwards difcharged from thence unferviceall fick Men able ; or, (as is sometimes the Cafe) being discharged from the Hofpital or sick Quarters into ships near at Hand, they are in a fhort Time turned on shore as unfit for service : And whereas Men, under either Circumftance, are reduced to great Distress and Misery for Want of their Wages, which, by the present Regulations, cannot be paid, because they have not the ufual Tickets of Difcharge ; in order to give the poor Men ( 197 ) Men, Relief herein, the Navy- Board are to cause printed Tickets, in the Form, ( Pages 230, 231 , ) to be issued to the feveral Commanders of His Majesty's ships and Vessels who are hereby ftrictly charged to take Care timely to apply for the fame, and always to have a sufficient Number of the said Tickets by them ; and whenever any Man, whether seamen or Marine, is fent to an Hospital or sick Quarters from any ship or Vessel of His Majesty's, her Commander is never to fail fending one of the said Tickets with him to the Agent for sick and Hurt, and to be particularly careful, that the Respective Columns be duly filled up, because, if the Man shall be discharged unserviceable from the Hofpital or sick Quarters, or put on Board any other ship than that from which he was fent, the Agent is to tranfmit the said Ticket, together with the customary Ticket of Discharge from the Hospital, to the commissioner of the Navy at the Port, or to the Navy-Board, and from them a proper Ticket is to be forthwith made out, and the Wages paid; or if the Man shall be put on Board any other ship befides that from which he was fent to the Hofpital or Quarters, and shall be turned on shore unferviceable before he gets back to his proper ship, a Ticket is to be made out, and his Wages paid as aforesaid, as soon as such Cafe happens : As therefore the ascertaining the Wages due to the Man, will depend upon the Accuracy in filling up the Ticket above directed to be fent with him to the Agent for sick and Hurt, the Commanders of His Majesty's 4 C c ships ( 198 ) New-raifed Mento be inDuty of sea- men. ships and Vessels are, respectively to be responsible for the Confequence of any Failure therein
 .
 VIII. It being of great Confequence to His Majesty's fructedin the service, that all new-raifed Men, and others, who may not be good seamen, fhould be inftructed and trained up in whatever may tend to make them most useful ; the Commanders of His Majesty's ships and Vessels are to caufe all such Men daily to lafh up their Hammacoes, and carry them to the proper Places for barricading the ship, whenever the Weather will permit : And also to take Care that they be practifed in going frequently every Day up and down the shrowds, and employed on all Kinds of Work, which are to be created on purpose for them, both to keep them in Action, and to teach them the Duty of seamen.
