 XLIV. When any Custom- House Officer shall come on Board, upon the Arrival of the ship in any of His Majesty's Ports, they are not to be obftructed or ill-treated in the Execution of their Duty, His Majesty's ships being liable to visitation as well as the ships of Merchants ; and if they shall be in Need of the ship's Provisions during their stay on Board, he is to order them to be victualled as the ship's Company.
 XLV. When he meets with any Foreign ship or Vessel, he is to send a commission Officer to enquire if any seamen, who are his Majesty's subjects, be on Board her, and to demand all such, obliging their Masters to pay them their Wages to that Day. But this is to be done with civil and friendly Behaviour on the Part of His Majesty's Officers, who are to be very careful not to offer any Violence or ill Treatment to the subjects of His Majesty's Friends or Allies.

 XLVIII. He is never to cause the ship to be painted either within Board or without, nor to bring any Charge in his Accounts for commission- Money, nor to bream the ship with old Junk, old Ropes, or Tar, when Brush or other Materials can be had; and what old masts, spars, Deals, and other Things remain after the Cleaning is over, are to be charged on the proper Offices for future use. 
 XLIX. None are to be employed, but the Company of the ship, in careening and refitting her ; but if, by reason of Death or sickness, there shall be an absolute Necessity of hiring any sort of Artificers from the shore, their Names are to be entered on a List, and they are to be daily mustered, and kept to their Works, and discharged as soon as they can be spared : And as they are to be hired on the cheapest Terms, so they are to be paid by the said List, in the Presence of two or more commission or Warrant Officers, who are to attest the said Payments. 
 L. And to encourage such Carpenters, shipwrights, Caulkers, as serve in His Majesty's ships in Foreign Parts, and shall be employed in Working, either in their own or other ships of His Majesty, while they are refitting, the Captain of the ship, which they work upon, shall make them the following Allowance by the Day, viz.

If the ship is in Company with other Men of War, he must apply to the Commander in Chief, or to the senior Officer, to order the said survey.
 LVII. In Case he shall be removed himself into another ship, he is to shew the Originals of all such Orders as have been sent to him, and remain unexecuted, to his successor, and leave with him attested Copies of the same, which shall be sufficient Warrant to his said successor, to put them in Execution.

And, for their Encouragement, they shall continue in Pay during their Attendance on that service. If the Provisions of the ship are loft, the Captain is to subsist them, and may draw Bills upon the commissioners of the Victualling for the same.
 LXI. When the ship comes to the Port where she is to be laid up, the Captain is to assemble the proper Officers together, and draw up an Account of the Observations that have been made during the Voyage of the Qualities of the ship ; the standing of her masts ; Quantity of Ballast ; Draught of Water; best sailing Trim ; stowage ; Manner of sailing ; and such other circumstances as may be necessary for the Information and Guidance of those who may command her afterwards ; which Account, signed by himself and the Officers, he is to deliver to the commissioners of the Navy at the Port, and transmit a Duplicate of the same to the Navy-Board.
 LXII. When Orders shall come for laying up the ship, he is, before he leaves her, to prepare five Pay- Books, with the Assistance of his Purser, according to the Form set down in Page ( 160, 161 ) together with three Alphabets ; taking Care, that the Pages of the Pay- Books agree together in the Number of Names, and to transmit the same without any Delay, to the Navy- Board, signed by himself and signing Officers, that His Majesty may not be put to an unnecessary Charge in continuing the ship in Pay for Want thereof; and he and his Officers are to attend the Payment of her.

 LXV. Lastly, Whereas the Charge and Command of the ship, and of the Officers and Men serving therein, are entirely entrusted to the Captain, and the Welfare and good Management of the Whole does in especial Manner depend upon his Oeconomy and Prudence, he is to understand, though the several Rules contained in the following Parts of this Book are sorted into different Chapters, for better Order and Clearness, that nevertheless he is himself responsible for the whole Conduct and good Government of the ship, and for the due Execution of all Regulations here set down which concern the several Duties of the Officers and Company of the ship, who are to obey him in all Things which he shall direct them for His Majesty's service. And whereas, by the Establishment of the Navy, he is allowed a Clerk, he is to look upon himself to be accountable for all Errors or Frauds committed by the said Clerk, who is regarded no otherwise than as his Instrument, and one appointed to serve him in the Execution of his Office. To receive no Wages without proper and to make mages. And, as he is not to receive his Wages without producing Certificates from the secretary of the Admiralty, Certificates, and from the Navy, Victualling, Ordnance, and sick and Wounded Offices, that they have nothing to object against him, so he is to expect to make good out of his Wages any Damage His Majesty may have sustained from his Neglect or Irregularity ; and in case of the ship's being paid off before such Discovery is made, to answer the same out of his Half- Pay, or be otherwise accountable, as the Lord High Admiral, or Lord's commissioners of the Admiralty, shall judge proper. 
 Rules of Discipline and good Government to be observed on Board His Majesty's ships of War. 
 Article I. In the first Place, the Commanders of His Majesty's ships are strictly required to shew in themselves a good Example of Honour and Virtue to their Officers and Men; and next, to be very vigilant in respecting the Behaviour of all such as are under them, and to discountenance and suppress all dissolute, immoral, and disorderly Practices, and all such as are contrary to the Rules of Discipline and Obedience, and to correct those who are guilty of the same, according to the usage of the sea.
 II. The Commanders of His Majesty's ships are to take Care that Divine service be performed twice a Day on Board, according to the Liturgy of the Church of England, and a sermon preached on sundays, unless bad Weather or some extraordinary Accidents prevent it.
 III. If any shall be heard to swear, Curse, or Blaspheme the Name of GOD, the Captain is strictly required to punish them for every Offence by causing them to wear a wooden Collar, or some other shameful Badge of Distinction, for so long a Time as he shall judge proper. If he be a commission Officer, he shall forfeit One shilling for each Offence, and a Warrant or inferior Officer, sixpence. He who is guilty of Drunkenness, if a seamen, shall be put into Irons until he is sober ; but if an Officer, he shall forfeit Two Days Pay. 
 IV. No Commander shall inflict any Punishment upon a seamen, beyond Twelve Lashes upon his bare Back with a Cat of Nine Tails, according to the ancient Practice of the sea ; but if the Fault shall deserve a greater Punishment, he is either to apply to the Commander in Chief, or inform the secretary of the Admiralty if the ship is at Home, in order to the Offender's being brought to a Court- Martial, if it shall be thought proper, and in the mean Time he may put him under Confinement.
 V. The Captain is never, by his own Authority, to discharge a commission or Warrant Officer, nor to  punish or strike him ; but if any are disobedient to suspend Command, or behave themselves so ill, that he judges them unfit for their Duty, he may suspend or confine them ; and when he comes in the Way of a Commander in Chief, apply to him for holding a Court-Martial; otherwise he is to acquaint the secretary of the Admiralty therewith.
 VI. The Officer, who commands on Board, by Accident of the Captain's Absence, (unless he be absent for a Time by Leave) shall not order any Correction, but Confinement; from which however he is not to release the Offender before the Captain's Return on Board, and then give him an Account of the Reasons for his so doing.
 VII. The Captain is to cause the Articles of War to be hung up in some Public Places of the ship, and read to the ship's Company once a Month. 
Instructions relating to the Execution of two Acts ofParliament passed Anno Imo. Geo. II in Favour of seamen employed in His Majesty's service. 
 I. WHEN any of His Majesty's ships shall be in Want of Men, and any seamen, or able- bodied Landmen, shall enter voluntarily with a commission Officer of the Fleet appointed to raise Men, and shall repair on Board within Fourteen Days, if the Place where he enters be not above One Hundred Miles distant from the ship ; or within the space of Twenty Days, if the ship be at a greater Distance than One Hundred Miles ; or within the space of Thirty Days, if the Distance be more than Two Hundred Miles, the Captain shall- enter his Name on the ship's Books for Wages from the Day of his Entry, and for Victuals from the Time of his Appearance ; and so soon as the ship is fully man'd he shall send Three Lists of the Names of all such Volunteers to the Navy Board, in the Forms hereunto annexed, Page ( 162, 163 , 164) in order to their being paid Conduct- Money, (to be computed from the Place of Entry) and an Advance of Two Months Wages, before the ship proceeds to sea.
 II. In Case any of the said seamen or Landmen shall, at their Request, be supplied with slop- Clothes or Bedding, at their coming on Board, the Captain is carefully to set off the Value of the same against their Names in the Lists he sends to the Navy- Board for Payment of the Two Months Advance of Wages, in order to their deducting the same. 
 III. When a Captain is removed from one ship to another, and takes along with him his servants, or any others out of the ship, (who shall not be turned over by Order from the Admiralty, but shall voluntarily go) it is here others, not declared, that all such Persons, and also seamen entering in Exchange for others discharged at their own Request, have no Title to the Advance of Two Months Wages, and the Captain is strictly charged not to insert any such in the Lists he shall make out for that Purpose.
 IV. When the ship shall have been in commission six Two Months whole Months, if she be then in any Port of Great- Britain, or on the Coasts thereof, and not under iOrders to be paid off, the Captain shall make out Three Pay Lists, according to the Form hereunto annexed, Page ( 166, 167. ) containing the Names of all the Inferior Officers and seamen belonging to the ship under his Command, specifying in such List, the Days on which every particular Man was entered on the ship's Books, and send the said Lists, signed by himself and the signing Officers, to the Navy- Board, in order to their paying them Two Months Wages.
 V. But if at the End of the said six Months, the ship shall be on the Coast of Ireland, or in Foreign Parts, the Captain shall then muster his Company, and set down in Lists as aforesaid the Names of such inferior Officers and seamen only, who shall desire to have Two Months Wages paid in London to their Attorneys, and send the same Home, by the first safe Opportunity, to the Navy-Board.
 VI. When the ship shall have been Twelve Months in six Months sea-pay, the Captain is to make out other Pay- Lists as aforesaid, of the Names of the inferior Officers and seamen belonging to the ship under his Command, and transmit the same to the Navy- Board, and so from Time to Time to observe to do the same at the End of every enfuing six Months, until the ship shall be finally paid off.
 VII. As to the Term, Inferior Officers, the Captain is to take Notice, that the same does not include any commission Officer, nor any Warrant Officer, except the second Master, surgeon's Mates, Cook, Armourer, gunsmith, school- Master, Master at Arms, Corporal, and sail-Maker.
 VIII. But notwithstanding what is before directed, for the making out Pay-Lists at the End of every six Months, of Eighteen for the Inferior Officers and seamen only, in order to their being paid Two Months Wages, yet if it shall so happen, that at the End of Eighteen Months, the ship shall be in any Port of Great-Britain, or on the Coasts of the same, the Captain shall then make out Pay- Books for Twelve Months, containing the Names of all the Officers and seamen in the ship, and transmit the same to the Navy- Board, it being directed by the Act, that the whole Company shall then receive Twelve Months Pay, including what may have been advanced.
 IX. The Captain is to make out the like Pay- Books every Time that the ship shall have been Eighteen Months in sea-Pay, beyond the Time she has been cleared to, in order to the Officers and Company being paid Twelve Months Wages again, as before.
 X. The Captain is to take Care, when any Inferior Officers, or Voluntier seamen are turned over into the ship under his Command from any other ship, not to rate them on the ship's Books in a worse Quality, or lower Degree or station, than they served in the ship they were removed from; and for his Guidance he is to demand from the Commander of the ship from which they were turned over, a List, under his Hand, of their Names and Qualities. He is to send Lists of the said Men to the Navy- Board, in order to their receiving Two Months Wages Advance, before the ship proceeds to sea. But if there be more Inferior Officers than the Establishment of the ship allows, he is immediately to acquaint the secretary of the Admiralty therewith.
 XI. When a Captain is ordered to turn over any Inferior Officers or Voluntier seamen from the ship under his Command, into any other of His Majesty's ships, he is not only to deliver a List of their Names and Qualities to the Captain of the ship they are removed into, but to send also compleat Pay- Lists to the Navy- Board, in order to their being paid the Wages due to them, as well as the Advance of two Months Wages.
 XII. It is to be understood, that if any ship is by Accident disabled from going to sea, and her whole Company is removed into another ship, the same is not to be taken to be a Turning-over within the Meaning of the Act.
 XIII. For a further Encouragement to seamen who shall Voluntier to serve His Majesty voluntarily, if any such seamen can at any Time get better Preferment in any other of His Majesty's ships, than he has in the ship he belongs to, the Captain he serves with is hereby required to discharge him to the Captain desiring him, upon the said Captain's giving him a good Man in his Room.
 XIV. The Captain is frequently to make known to ship's Company, that no Letters of Attorney, made them to empower persons to receive their Wages, valid, unless they be made revocable, and signed before and attested by, the Captain or Commander, and one Mayor of other of the signing Officers of the ship to which they belong; or by the Clerk of the Cheque of some of the Dock Yards, or by the Mayor or Chief Magistrate of some Corporation.
 XV. He is to discourage the seamen of his ship from selling any Part of their Wages, by all Ways and Means discourage the possible, and never to attest to the Letter of Attorney selling their of any seaman, until he is fully satisfied that the same Wages. is not granted in Consideration of Money given for the Purchase of his Wages.
 XVI. When an Inferior Officer or seaman dies, the Captain is forthwith to make out a Ticket for the Time of his service, and send the same, by the first safe Conveyance to the Navy- Board, in order to the Wages being forthwith paid to the Executors or Administrators of the Deceased. 
 XVII. When any of His Majesty's ships are in Foreign Parts, and His Majesty's Governors, Ministers or Consuls, or any Two or more British Merchants, shall apply to the Captain to receive any seafaring Men or Boys, subjects of Great Britain or Ireland, who shall, by shipwreck, Capture, or other unavoidable Accident, be driven into those Parts, he is to receive them on Board, and to bear such as come within his Complement for Wages and Victuals, and the Rest for Victuals only. He is strictly charged, upon his meeting with any of His Majesty's ships, to inform himself from the Captain, if she is short of her Complement, and to put as many of his supernumeraries on Board her, as shall make her Complement, and to continue to do the same, until they are all disposed of; but if he shall not meet with any of His Majesty's ships, he is then to discharge and set ashore the said supernumeraries at any Port in Great-Britain, that he shall be bound to. 
 Rules for the Cure of sick or Hurt seamen on Board their own ships. 
 I. Convenient Room shall be made between Decks, in all His Majesty's ships, for the Reception of sick or Hurt seamen, whither they are to be removed with their Hammacoes and Bedding, when the surgeon shall advise the same to be necessary.
 II. The Captain is to appoint some of the ship's company to attend and serve the sick Men Night and Day by Turns, and to keep the Place clean.
 III. The Cooper may, by the Captain's Directions, make out of any old staves and Hoops, Buckets with Covers, for the necessary occasions of the sick Men ; and if any of them have fractured Bones or such Ailments, as require their lying in Cradles, the Carpenter may make such a Number as shall be necessary.
 IV. All ships of War, furnished with Fishing- Tackle, being in such Places where Fish is to be had, the Captain is to employ some of the Company in Fishing; and  the Fish, which shall be caught, shall be distributed daily to such persons as are sick or upon Recovery; and if there be any surplus, the same shall be distributed by Turns amongst the Messes of the Officers and seamen, without Favour or Partiality, and gratis, without any Deduction of their Allowance of Provision on that Account. 
 Rules to be observed in sending sick or Hurt seamen out of His Majesty's ships for Cure. 
 I. None are to be sent into the Hospitals, either attending the Fleet, or ashore, but whose distempers or Hurts are such, as may make it inconvenient to have them kept on Board their own ships.
 II. When any Men are ordered into the Hospitals ashore, their Cloaths and Bedding are to be sent along with them, together with a Ticket directed to the Agent, expressing their Names, Entry and Numbers on the ship's Books, with the Quality of their Disease or Hurt; which Ticket is to be signed by the Captain surgeon, and other signing Officers of the ship.
 III. If any of the said Men shall be in Want of proper necessaries at their going away from the ship, the Captain may order the Purser to supply them out of the slop Cloaths.
 IV. The Captain is to take Care to send the sick Men ashore under the Charge of a discreet Officer, accompanied by the surgeon or one of his Mates, and that they be carefully secured from the Weather, and to land them at the nearest Place to the Hospital ; and those Officers are to see them safely conveyed thither, with proper Carriages or otherwise, at the Expence of the Hospital.
 V. The Captain is to send a commission Officer to the Hospital twice a Week (on the muster Days) with a Boat, to receive such of his own Men from the Agent musters, and as may be recovered. And he shall likewise receive such other recovered Men (whose ships are not in the Way) as the Agent shall desire, unless any appear to be unfit for service; in which Case he is to give a Certificate thereof to the Agent for his Justification. 
 VI. He is likewise to receive such recovered Men, as an Agent of the sick and Wounded shall send to him, though the ship be at a distant Place from the Hospital, unless they be unserviceable ; and in that Case, shall give the said Men Certificates of his Refusal, and the Reason. 
 VII. If the Captain who receives recovered Men belonging to another ship, shall meet with that ship, he shall return them to their own ship, bearing them to keep them, only for Victuals; but if their proper ship shall at that Time have her full Complement of Men, he is then to enter them as Part of his own ship's Company, if he be in Want of Men, or otherwise to dispose of them to such of His Majesty's ships as may not have compleated their Complements, where they are to be borne for Wages, from the Time they were received from sick Quarters. 
 VIII. If the Agent shall certify to the Captain, that he has supplied any sick Men with Cloaths, whilst they were in Quarters, of which they were absolutely in Want he is to charge the same against their Names on the ship's Books, in order to its being defalked out of their Wages; but the Agent is not to do it whilst the ship is in Port, but to apply to the Captain to be supplied out of the slop Cloaths on Board.
 IX. If any Man, who is put ashore for Cure, does not return on Board his ship as soon as he is discharged from sick Quarters, or is left in sick Quarters when the ship departs, a Query is to be put against his Name, which shall be a stop to the Payment of his Wages, until he proves that he was not able to get on Board his own ship, but entered immediately into some other of His Majesty's ships, or was discharged from sick Quarters as unfit for service.
 X. The Captain is to correspond with the commissioners of the sick and Wounded, to know whether any of his Men in Quarters are Dead, Run, discharged, or other-wise disposed of, in order to his noting the same upon his Books.
 XI. Admirals and Commanders in Chief, as also the commissioner of the Navy, at the Ports where Hospitals are established, are to visit them frequently, and to see how the Men under Cure are treated, as well with respect to the Attendance of the Physician and the surgeon, as also to their Food, Lodging, and other circumstances. And the better to come at the Knowledge of any Abuses they are to examine the Men, and hear their Complaints, and to redress themselves little Irregularities upon the spot ; but if they discover any wilful Mismanagement, they are to represent it to the Admiralty.
 XI. In case there shall be a Necessity of putting sick or wounded Men ashore for Cure in Foreign Parts, where there are none of His Majesty's Hospitals, nor any correspondents of the sick and Wounded Office to take Charge of them, the Captain is to provide them with proper Food, Lodging, and other necessaries, (the surgeon of the ship and his Assistants attending on them in what relates to their Duty) and may draw Bills on the commissioners of the sick and Wounded for what Expence he shall be at, passing his Accounts thereof at the End of the Voyage. But as nothing will be allowed him thereon beyond the usual Establishment, he is, before he sails on a Foreign Voyage, to inform himself thereof from the sick and Wounded Office, and receive from thence what Rules and Instructions may be proper for his Knowledge and Guidance. 
 Of the Provisions. Article I. ΤΗERE shall be allowed to every Man serving a daily Proportion of Provisions, according as is expressed in the following Table, viz. Biscuit, Beer, Beef, Pork, Pease, Oatmeal, i Pounds, Gallons, Pounds, Pounds, Pint, Pint, Butter, Cheese , Averdupois Winchester Ounces. Measure.Averdupois. Measure. Measure. Ounces, I I half. I 2 4 sunday I Monday I Tuesday I 2 Wednesday I Thursday Friday I saturday · I I 2
 II. It is left to the Discretion of the Commanders of squadrons to shorten the aforesaid Allowance of Provisions according to the Exigence of the service, taking Care that the Men be punctually paid for the same. The like Power is given to Captains of single ships, in Cases of absolute Necessity; but the Purser is strictly charged not to supply any Officer at whole Allowance, whilst the rest of the Company are at short ; but all are to be equal in Point of Victualling.
 III. In case it shall be thought for the service to alter in any of the aforegoing Particulars of Provisions in ships employed in Foreign Voyages, it is to be observed, that a Pint of Wine, or Half a Pint of Brandy, Rum, or Arrack, hold Proportion to a Gallon of Beer'; Four Pounds of Flour, or Three Pounds of the same, with a Pound of Raisins ; Half a Pound of Currants, or Half a Pound of Beef suet pickled, are equal to a Four Pound Piece of Beef, or Two Pound Piece of Pork with Pease ; Half a Pound of Rice is equal to a Pint of Oatmeal ; a Pint of Olive Oil is equal to a Pound of Butter, or to Two Pound of suffolk Cheese ; and Two Thirds of a Pound of Cheshire Cheese is equal to One Pound of suffolk. 
 IV. The Beef provided for His Majesty's ships is to be cut into Four Pound Pieces, and the Pork into Two Pound Pieces ; and no unusal Pieces are to be put up, such as Leg Bones, shins of Oxen, Cheeks of Hogs, Ox Hearts, &c. and every Cask of Provisions is to have the Contents thereof marked on the Head.
 V. And to judge whether the Flesh served to His Majesty's ships, holds out in just Weight, the following Rule is to be observed, viz. Every Twenty-eight Pieces of Beef cut for Four Pound Pieces, taken out of the Cask as they rise, and the salt shaken off, are to weigh One Hundred Pounds Averdupois; and every Fifty-six Pieces of Pork, cut for Two Pound Pieces, and taken out and shaken in the like Manner, are to weigh One Hundred and Four Pounds; and therefore if, according to this standard, upon the weighing a whole Cask of Beef or Pork, in the Presence of two or more of the Warrant Officers of the ship, there shall be found a Deficiency of Weight, the Captain may order the Purser to issue to the seamen so much more Beef or Pork as shall make up the Deficiency; and upon producing the Oath of one of the said Officers, together with the Commander's Certificate, that he did, by his Order, issue to the ship's Company the like Number of Pieces of Beef or Pork, in lieu of the shortness of Weight, he shall have Credit for the same upon his Accounts.
 VI. If it shall happen that any of His Majesty's ships shall be in Want of Pork, the Captain is to order Three Pounds of Beef to be issued to the Men in lieu of a Two Pound Piece of Pork.
 VII. For the better Preservation of the Health of the seamen, it is ordered, that one Day in every Week there shall be issued out to them a Proportion of Flour and suet in lieu of Beef; but this is not to extend beyond Four Months Victualling at one Time, nor shall the Purser receive any Allowance for Flour or suet kept longer on Board than that Time. And there shall be supplied once a Year, from the Victualling Office, a Proportion of Canvas for Pudding Bags, after the Rate of One Ell to every sixteen Men.
 VIII.

He is to give timely notice to the Captain, upon all occasions of bringing Powder on Board, and not to remove any out of the ship, or from one Part of her to another, or fill Cartridges, or prepare Fuzees, Fireworks, &c. without the Captain's Direction, that he may give Orders for extinguishing the Fire and Candles, and Posting Centinels at all proper Places, to prevent Accidents ; and the Decks are immediately after to be thoroughly swabbed, and cleaned of the loose Powder that may have fallen. 
 VI. He is never to go or send any one into the Powder-Rooms, but by Leave from the Captain ; and to take Care that nobody enters with such Things about him, as may strike Fire in falling.

 XII. As to the Proportion of Powder to be spent on the occasion of service or scaling, he is to observe the Regulation set down in a Table, ( Page 174. ) 
 XIII. After firing five or six Rounds on warm service, he is to reduce the Allowance of Powder proportionably, until the same is lessened to one third of the Weight of the shot. And he is not to wet a Gun with a swab, when it grows warm with frequent Firing, this Practice having been the Occasion of splitting several, by checking the Metal with cold Water.
 XIV. When the Guns are received on Board, either upon first setting out, or after refitting, he is to take partipcular Care that they be all put into their proper Carriages to which they are numbered, and place N° 1 , the foremost Gun on the Larboard side, on each Deck, and the highest Number the aforemost Gun on the starboard side ; by observing which Rule, all the Guns will fit their Carriages, and stand a proper Height from the sill of the Ports. N. B. The Guns of every ship have a Number engraved on them over the Trunnion, and have their proper Carriages marked with the same Number on the Bracket, under or near to the Trunnion. The Guns and Carriages for the Larboard side of each Deck are numbered and marked on the Larboard side, and those of the starboard side are numbered and marked on the starboard side.

But he is to take Notice, that no Cask used for Washing- Tubs, steep- Tubs, or by the Cook, will be allowed as an extra Expence, they being to be included in the ordinary Allowance for Waste ; and all Casks made use of in the Tops, or on the Quarters, that are not cut, are not to be looked upon as expended, nor the Iron Hoops on the Casks that are cut to stand between the Guns. any

Additional REGULATIONs and INsTRUCTIONs relating to His Majesty's service at sea. ARTICLE I. WHEREAs by the Fifty-ninth Article of the When reGeneral printed Instructions, the Captains of movedtoanoHis Majesty's ships are permitted, when ' they are re- remove only moved by commission from one ship into another, to vants with carry along with them the following Number of Men, including their own servants, viz. Rate. From a ift 2d 3d 4th 5th - Men. 80 65 50 40 his own him. 20 6th 10 Bb 2 But ( 192 ) Not to discharge any particular Order. 8 But the same having been attended with Inconveniencies and Prejudice to the service, every Commander is hereby required, when a Press shall be on Foot, never to remove with him from one ship to another any Number of Men whatsoever, his own servants excepted, without a written Order for so doing from the Admiralty or the Commander in Chief at the Port where the ship may be.
II. There being reason to believe , that, in Times of Man without pressing, the Captains of some of His Majesty's ships have taken an unjustifiable Liberty of discharging Men whom they did not like , or fending them on shore in their Boats, thereby giving them an Opportunity of deferting; every Commander of His Majesty's ships and Vessels is hereby strictly charged and required (when a Prefs shall be on Foot) not to presume to discharge any Man, on any Account whatsoever, without an Order from this Board, or a Flag Officer ; and to Not to give avoid giving Opportunities for Desertion , he is as Opportunities strictly charged never to send or employ any Men on fordesertion. shore (if it can possibly be avoided) or send any in Merchant ships in Lieu of Preft Men, or to give Leave of Absence to any, unless they are Truft-worthy, and may be depended upon for their Return ; but to take Care to keep them strictly to their Duty, unless there shall be an absolute Necessity, by Reason of sickness, to send them to Hospitals for Cure ; and, in that Case, to take as much Care as possible may be, that they be sent on shore in such Manner, + as ( 193 ) as not to give them Opportunity to defert, and that they be brought on Board again as soon as recovered of their sickness
 III. There being great Reason to believe that it is a frequent Practice for Commanders of His Majesty's Jenton shore ships to send Men to Hospitals or sick Quarters for cannotbe taken due flight Ailments or Hurts, which might very well be Care ofon taken Care of and cured on Board the ships to which Board. they belong And whereas such Proceeding is not only burthensome to the Public, by occasioning a great additional Expence while the Men are under Cure, but is attended with a ftill much worfe Confequence to the service, by the Loss of many Men, who make use of the Opportunity thereby afforded them to defert : For Remedy of thefe Evils, every Commander of His Majesty's ships and Vessels is hereby strictly enjoined never to send any Men to an Hospital or sick Quarters, unless their distempers or Hurts are such, or the Number of sick and Hurt so great, that they cannot be taken due Care of on Board, which the surgeon of the ship is to certify, under his Hand, before any Man whatever is sent to such Hospital or Quarters : And in Order to a due Obfervance hereof, we do farther direct, that when any Men are sent sick on shore, the Physician and surgeon of the Hospital do forthwith examine them; and if they find any who might have been taken due Care of, and probably cured in a little Time on Board their ships, and therefore ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing ( 194 ) To send Ac- counts monthly, and on a Cruize, to aforegoing Injunction , to have been sent on shore, they are to certify the same to the Commanding Officer at the Port, who is immediately to cause them to be returned to their ships, and to transmit the Certificate from the Physician and surgeon to the Navy-Board, who are thereupon to cause Twenty shillings for each Man so improperly sent on shore, to be charged against the Wages of the surgeon of the ship from which they were sent, and to be abated therefrom. And whenever the Hospitals or sick Quarters are visited by a commissioner for sick and Hurt, who is a Physician or surgeon, if he finds any persons entertained therein , who ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing Regulation, to have been received , the commissioners for sick and Hurt are to cause the surgeon and the Agent at the Hospital or sick Quarters to be mulcted Twenty shillings each for every Man so entertained. "
 IV. He is strictly enjoined punctually to comply with the latter Part of the Eighteenth Article of the GeReturn from neral printed Instructions, directing, (if the ship is in the Admiral Great Britain or Ireland) a Monthly Account of Men, discharged, discharged to be sent to the Admiralty Office ; and, deferted, and in Addition thereto, he is, whenever the ship puts ty, of Men dead. into any Port of Great Britain or Ireland from a Cruize, to send a like Account of Men discharged, between the Time the last Account ended, and the Time of so putting into Port. He is also strictly to comply ( 195 ) t comply with the sixteenth Article of the said Instructions, by fending constant Accounts to the secretary of the Admiralty, of Men who defert, at the Times such Desertions happen ; and, moreover, whenever he fends an Account of Men discharged as above directed , he is strictly enjoined to transmit an Account of Men who have deferted within the same Period of Time that the Account of discharged Men includes, and to note against them the several Particulars prefcribed in the Fifteenth Article of the said Instructions. He is also further strictly directed , when he fends the aforementioned Accounts to transmit with them a third Account, containing the Names and Qualities of all the Men who have died within the same Periods of Time : And if he shall have supernumeraries on Board, he is to distinguish in each Account which of the Men were Part of his Complement, and which were supernumeraries.
 V. Great Inconvenience having arisen to the service , and To make out a Ticketfor also great Difcouragement to scamen serving in His Ma- every Man jefty's ships, from Captains sometimes discharging Men discharged. without Tickets, every Commander is hereby enjoined to a very strict and punctual Compliance with the seventeenth Article of the General printed Instructions, (under the Head of the Captain or Commander) in relation to making out Tickets for every person who shall be discharged ; and, if the Party shall be dead or absent, the Commander is strictly charged to transmit his ( 196 ) Pay Lists to be made out one ship to his Ticket immediately, or by the very first Opportunity, to the Navy- Board. And whenever any Ticket is made out, he is strictly charged to see that all Deductions, of any Kind whatsoever, that ought to be made from the Wages of the Party, be carefully set off, upon Pain of making good the Value of any sailure therein.
 VI. When any Men borne for Wages shall be diffor Mien dif- charged from one ship or Vessel to another, the Capchargedfrom tain of the ship or Vessel from which they shall be discharged, is to be particularly careful to send immediately to the Navy-Board proper Pay- Lists for such Men, in order that they may be paid the Wages due to them as soon as possible after their being so discharged. another.
