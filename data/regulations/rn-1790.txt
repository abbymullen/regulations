 II. There being Reafon to believe , that, in Times of Man without Preffing, the Captains of fome of His Majefty's ships have taken an unjustifiable Liberty of discharging Men whom they did not like , or fending them on shore in their Boats, thereby giving them an Opportunity of deferting; every Commander of His Majefty's ships and Veffels is hereby ftrictly charged and required (when a Prefs shall be on Foot) not to presume to difcharge any Man, on any Account whatsoever, without an Order from this Board, or a Flag Officer ; and to Not to give avoid giving Opportunities for Desertion , he is as Opportunities ftrictly charged never to fend or employ any Men on forDefertion. shore (if it can poffibly be avoided) or fend any in Merchant ships in Lieu of Preft Men, or to give Leave of Abfence to any, unless they are Truft-worthy, and may be depended upon for their Return ; but to take Care to keep them ftrictly to their Duty, unlefs there fhall be an abfolute Neceffity, by Reason of sickness, to fend them to Hofpitals for Cure ; and, in that Cafe, to take as much Care as poffible may be, that they be sent on shore in fuch Manner, + as ( 193 ) as not to give them Opportunity to defert, and that they be brought on Board again as soon as recovered of their sickness
 . :
 III. except fuch as There being great Reason to believe that it is a No sick to be frequent Practice for Commanders of His Majefty's Jenton shore ships to fend Men to Hospitals or sick Quarters for cannotbe taken due flight Ailments or Hurts, which might very well be Care ofon taken Care of and cured on Board the ships to which Board. they belong And whereas fuch Proceeding is not only burthenfome to the Public, by occafioning a great additional Expence while the Men are under Cure, but is attended with a ftill much worfe Confequence to the service, by the Lofs of many Men, who make use of the Opportunity thereby afforded them to defert : For Remedy of thefe Evils, every Commander of His Majefty's ships and Veffels is hereby ftrictly enjoined never to fend any Men to an Hospital or sick Quarters, unless their Diftempers or Hurts are fuch, or the Number of sick and Hurt fo great, that they cannot be taken due Care of on Board, which the surgeon of the ship is to certify, under his Hand, before any Man whatever is fent to fuch Hospital or Quarters : And in Order to a due Obfervance hereof, we do farther direct, that when any Men are sent sick on shore, the Physician and surgeon of the Hofpital do forthwith examine them; and if they find any who might have been taken due Care of, and probably cured in a little Time on Board their ships, and therefore ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing ( 194 ) To fend Ac- counts monthly, and on a Cruize, to aforegoing Injunction , to have been fent on shore, they are to certify the fame to the Commanding Officer at the Port, who is immediately to cause them to be returned to their ships, and to tranfmit the Certificate from the Phyfician and surgeon to the Navy-Board, who are thereupon to cause Twenty shillings for each Man fo improperly fent on shore, to be charged against the Wages of the surgeon of the ship from which they were fent, and to be abated therefrom. And whenever the Hofpitals or sick Quarters are visited by a Commiffioner for sick and Hurt, who is a Physician or surgeon, if he finds any Perfons entertained therein , who ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing Regulation, to have been received , the Commiffioners for sick and Hurt are to cause the surgeon and the Agent at the Hofpital or sick Quarters to be mulcted Twenty shillings each for every Man fo entertained. "
 IV. He is ftrictly enjoined punctually to comply with the latter Part of the Eighteenth Article of the GeReturn from neral printed Inftructions, directing, (if the ship is in the Admiral Great Britain or Ireland) a Monthly Account of Men, discharged, difcharged to be fent to the Admiralty Office ; and, deferted, and in Addition thereto, he is, whenever the ship puts ty, of Men dead. into any Port of Great Britain or Ireland from a Cruize, to fend a like Account of Men discharged, between the Time the laft Account ended, and the Time of fo putting into Port. He is also strictly to comply ( 195 ) t comply with the sixteenth Article of the said Inftructions, by fending conftant Accounts to the secretary of the Admiralty, of Men who defert, at the Times fuch Desertions happen ; and, moreover, whenever he fends an Account of Men discharged as above directed , he is ftrictly enjoined to tranfmit an Account of Men who have deferted within the fame Period of Time that the Account of discharged Men includes, and to note against them the feveral Particulars prefcribed in the Fifteenth Article of the faid Inftructions. He is also further ftrictly directed , when he fends the aforementioned Accounts to tranfmit with them a third Account, containing the Names and Qualities of all the Men who have died within the fame Periods of Time : And if he shall have supernumeraries on Board, he is to distinguish in each Account which of the Men were Part of his Complement, and which were supernumeraries.
 V. Great Inconvenience having arifen to the service , and To make out a Ticketfor alfo great Difcouragement to scamen ferving in His Ma- every Man jefty's ships, from Captains fometimes discharging Men discharged. without Tickets, every Commander is hereby enjoined to a very strict and punctual Compliance with the seventeenth Article of the General printed Inftructions, (under the Head of the Captain or Commander) in relation to making out Tickets for every Perfon who fhall be difcharged ; and, if the Party shall be dead or absent, the Commander is strictly charged to tranfmit his ( 196 ) Pay Lifts to be made out one ship to his Ticket immediately, or by the very first Opportunity, to the Navy- Board. And whenever any Ticket is made out, he is ftrictly charged to fee that all Deductions, of any Kind whatsoever, that ought to be made from the Wages of the Party, be carefully fet off, upon Pain of making good the Value of any Failure therein.
 VI. When any Men borne for Wages fhall be diffor Mien dif- charged from one ship or Vessel to another, the Capchargedfrom tain of the ship or Veffel from which they shall be discharged, is to be particularly careful to fend immediately to the Navy-Board proper Pay- Lifts for fuch Men, in order that they may be paid the Wages due to them as foon as poffible after their being so discharged. another. Particular to Agent for sick and fent on shore.
