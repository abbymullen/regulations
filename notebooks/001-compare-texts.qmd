This document lets you input arbitrary documents and see their similarity scores.

Put the documents you want to compare here.

```{r}
documents <- c(
	"usn1802" = "1. He is to inform the secretary of the navy of all his proceedings which relate to the service.",
	"rn1790" = " ARTICLE I. The Flag- Officer, or Commander in Chief, is to inform the secretary of the Admiralty of the Admiralty all his Proceedings that relate to the service, for the Information of the Lord High Admiral, or Lords commissioners of the Admiralty."
)
```


```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(textreuse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(readr))
source("../R/helpers.R")
```

Run this to see how the cleaning is being applied

```{r}
stop_phrases <- read_lines("../data/stops.txt")
documents <- clean_texts(documents, stop_phrases)
```



Run this to get the results for just those documents

```{r}
sections <- TextReuseCorpus(text = documents,
                            tokenizer = tokenize_ngrams,
                            n = 5,
                            keep_tokens = TRUE,
														progress = FALSE)

comparisons <- pairwise_compare(sections, jaccard_similarity,
                                progress = FALSE)
comparisons
```

```{r}
tokens_1 <- textreuse::tokenize_ngrams(documents[1], n = 3)
tokens_2 <- textreuse::tokenize_ngrams(documents[2], n = 3)
intersect(tokens_1, tokens_2)
jaccard_similarity(tokens_1, tokens_2)
```
