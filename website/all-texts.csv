rn-1790-00146," II. The Captain is to appoint some of the ship's company to attend and serve the sick Men Night and Day by Turns, and to keep the Place clean.
"
rn-1790-00147," III. The Cooper may, by the Captain's Directions, make out of any old staves and Hoops, Buckets with Covers, for the necessary occasions of the sick Men ; and if any of them have fractured Bones or such Ailments, as require their lying in Cradles, the Carpenter may make such a Number as shall be necessary.
"
rn-1790-00148," IV. All ships of War, furnished with Fishing- Tackle, being in such Places where Fish is to be had, the Captain is to employ some of the Company in Fishing; and  the Fish, which shall be caught, shall be distributed daily to such persons as are sick or upon Recovery; and if there be any surplus, the same shall be distributed by Turns amongst the Messes of the Officers and seamen, without Favour or Partiality, and gratis, without any Deduction of their Allowance of Provision on that Account. 
"
rn-1790-00149," Rules to be observed in sending sick or Hurt seamen out of His Majesty's ships for Cure. 
"
rn-1790-00150," I. None are to be sent into the Hospitals, either attending the Fleet, or ashore, but whose distempers or Hurts are such, as may make it inconvenient to have them kept on Board their own ships.
"
rn-1790-00151," II. When any Men are ordered into the Hospitals ashore, their Cloaths and Bedding are to be sent along with them, together with a Ticket directed to the Agent, expressing their Names, Entry and Numbers on the ship's Books, with the Quality of their Disease or Hurt; which Ticket is to be signed by the Captain surgeon, and other signing Officers of the ship.
"
rn-1790-00152," III. If any of the said Men shall be in Want of proper necessaries at their going away from the ship, the Captain may order the Purser to supply them out of the slop Cloaths.
"
rn-1790-00153," IV. The Captain is to take Care to send the sick Men ashore under the Charge of a discreet Officer, accompanied by the surgeon or one of his Mates, and that they be carefully secured from the Weather, and to land them at the nearest Place to the Hospital ; and those Officers are to see them safely conveyed thither, with proper Carriages or otherwise, at the Expence of the Hospital.
"
rn-1790-00154," V. The Captain is to send a commission Officer to the Hospital twice a Week (on the muster Days) with a Boat, to receive such of his own Men from the Agent musters, and as may be recovered. And he shall likewise receive such other recovered Men (whose ships are not in the Way) as the Agent shall desire, unless any appear to be unfit for service; in which Case he is to give a Certificate thereof to the Agent for his Justification. 
"
rn-1790-00155," VI. He is likewise to receive such recovered Men, as an Agent of the sick and Wounded shall send to him, though the ship be at a distant Place from the Hospital, unless they be unserviceable ; and in that Case, shall give the said Men Certificates of his Refusal, and the Reason. 
"
rn-1790-00156," VII. If the Captain who receives recovered Men belonging to another ship, shall meet with that ship, he shall return them to their own ship, bearing them to keep them, only for Victuals; but if their proper ship shall at that Time have her full Complement of Men, he is then to enter them as Part of his own ship's Company, if he be in Want of Men, or otherwise to dispose of them to such of His Majesty's ships as may not have compleated their Complements, where they are to be borne for Wages, from the Time they were received from sick Quarters. 
"
rn-1790-00157," VIII. If the Agent shall certify to the Captain, that he has supplied any sick Men with Cloaths, whilst they were in Quarters, of which they were absolutely in Want he is to charge the same against their Names on the ship's Books, in order to its being defalked out of their Wages; but the Agent is not to do it whilst the ship is in Port, but to apply to the Captain to be supplied out of the slop Cloaths on Board.
"
rn-1790-00158," IX. If any Man, who is put ashore for Cure, does not return on Board his ship as soon as he is discharged from sick Quarters, or is left in sick Quarters when the ship departs, a Query is to be put against his Name, which shall be a stop to the Payment of his Wages, until he proves that he was not able to get on Board his own ship, but entered immediately into some other of His Majesty's ships, or was discharged from sick Quarters as unfit for service.
"
rn-1790-00159," X. The Captain is to correspond with the commissioners of the sick and Wounded, to know whether any of his Men in Quarters are Dead, Run, discharged, or other-wise disposed of, in order to his noting the same upon his Books.
"
rn-1790-00160," XI. Admirals and Commanders in Chief, as also the commissioner of the Navy, at the Ports where Hospitals are established, are to visit them frequently, and to see how the Men under Cure are treated, as well with respect to the Attendance of the Physician and the surgeon, as also to their Food, Lodging, and other circumstances. And the better to come at the Knowledge of any Abuses they are to examine the Men, and hear their Complaints, and to redress themselves little Irregularities upon the spot ; but if they discover any wilful Mismanagement, they are to represent it to the Admiralty.
"
rn-1790-00161," XI. In case there shall be a Necessity of putting sick or wounded Men ashore for Cure in Foreign Parts, where there are none of His Majesty's Hospitals, nor any correspondents of the sick and Wounded Office to take Charge of them, the Captain is to provide them with proper Food, Lodging, and other necessaries, (the surgeon of the ship and his Assistants attending on them in what relates to their Duty) and may draw Bills on the commissioners of the sick and Wounded for what Expence he shall be at, passing his Accounts thereof at the End of the Voyage. But as nothing will be allowed him thereon beyond the usual Establishment, he is, before he sails on a Foreign Voyage, to inform himself thereof from the sick and Wounded Office, and receive from thence what Rules and Instructions may be proper for his Knowledge and Guidance. 
"
rn-1790-00162," Of the Provisions. Article I. ΤΗERE shall be allowed to every Man serving a daily Proportion of Provisions, according as is expressed in the following Table, viz. Biscuit, Beer, Beef, Pork, Pease, Oatmeal, i Pounds, Gallons, Pounds, Pounds, Pint, Pint, Butter, Cheese , Averdupois Winchester Ounces. Measure. Averdupois. Measure. Measure. Ounces, I I half. I 2 4 sunday I Monday I Tuesday I 2 Wednesday I Thursday Friday I saturday · I I 2
"
rn-1790-00163," II. It is left to the Discretion of the Commanders of squadrons to shorten the aforesaid Allowance of Provisions according to the Exigence of the service, taking Care that the Men be punctually paid for the same. The like Power is given to Captains of single ships, in Cases of absolute Necessity; but the Purser is strictly charged not to supply any Officer at whole Allowance, whilst the rest of the Company are at short ; but all are to be equal in Point of Victualling.
"
rn-1790-00164," III. In case it shall be thought for the service to alter in any of the aforegoing Particulars of Provisions in ships employed in Foreign Voyages, it is to be observed, that a Pint of Wine, or Half a Pint of Brandy, Rum, or Arrack, hold Proportion to a Gallon of Beer'; Four Pounds of Flour, or Three Pounds of the same, with a Pound of Raisins ; Half a Pound of Currants, or Half a Pound of Beef suet pickled, are equal to a Four Pound Piece of Beef, or Two Pound Piece of Pork with Pease ; Half a Pound of Rice is equal to a Pint of Oatmeal ; a Pint of Olive Oil is equal to a Pound of Butter, or to Two Pound of suffolk Cheese ; and Two Thirds of a Pound of Cheshire Cheese is equal to One Pound of suffolk. 
"
rn-1790-00165," IV. The Beef provided for His Majesty's ships is to be cut into Four Pound Pieces, and the Pork into Two Pound Pieces ; and no unusal Pieces are to be put up, such as Leg Bones, shins of Oxen, Cheeks of Hogs, Ox Hearts, &c. and every Cask of Provisions is to have the Contents thereof marked on the Head.
"
rn-1790-00166," V. And to judge whether the Flesh served to His Majesty's ships, holds out in just Weight, the following Rule is to be observed, viz. Every Twenty-eight Pieces of Beef cut for Four Pound Pieces, taken out of the Cask as they rise, and the salt shaken off, are to weigh One Hundred Pounds Averdupois; and every Fifty-six Pieces of Pork, cut for Two Pound Pieces, and taken out and shaken in the like Manner, are to weigh One Hundred and Four Pounds; and therefore if, according to this standard, upon the weighing a whole Cask of Beef or Pork, in the Presence of two or more of the Warrant Officers of the ship, there shall be found a Deficiency of Weight, the Captain may order the Purser to issue to the seamen so much more Beef or Pork as shall make up the Deficiency; and upon producing the Oath of one of the said Officers, together with the Commander's Certificate, that he did, by his Order, issue to the ship's Company the like Number of Pieces of Beef or Pork, in lieu of the shortness of Weight, he shall have Credit for the same upon his Accounts.
"
rn-1790-00167," VI. If it shall happen that any of His Majesty's ships shall be in Want of Pork, the Captain is to order Three Pounds of Beef to be issued to the Men in lieu of a Two Pound Piece of Pork.
"
rn-1790-00168," VII. For the better Preservation of the Health of the seamen, it is ordered, that one Day in every Week there shall be issued out to them a Proportion of Flour and suet in lieu of Beef; but this is not to extend beyond Four Months Victualling at one Time, nor shall the Purser receive any Allowance for Flour or suet kept longer on Board than that Time. And there shall be supplied once a Year, from the Victualling Office, a Proportion of Canvas for Pudding Bags, after the Rate of One Ell to every sixteen Men.
"
rn-1790-00169," VIII. In the Victualling His Majesty's ships for Foreign Voyages, there shall be only supplied Three Months Butter and Cheese, the Remainder of those species to be made up in Olive Oil; but for the Mediterranean, the Pursers are to be supplied with Credit or Foreign Money, (if Credit cannot be had) for procuring Oil Abroad. 
"
rn-1790-00170," IX. There shall be allowed to every ship, in Home Voyages, One Tun of Cask for Water-Cask, Iron bound, with one Bundle of Wood Hoops, and one of Flags, (if required) for every Hundred Men per Month, and so proportionably; but in Foreign Voyages there shall be allowed such farther Quantity of Water Cask as the ship can conveniently stow, or shall be thought necessary. 
"
rn-1790-00171," X. In ships employed in Home service, half the Quantity of Beer taken on Board shall be contained in the Iron-bound Cask; but in Foreign Voyages, Three Fourths of the Beer Cask shall be Iron-bound : And no Cask shall be used for Beer, but what have been gauged by a sworn Guager, who is to mark on the Head the Contents in Gallons, Winchester Measure.
"
rn-1790-00172," XI. All Cask, supplied to ships bound on Foreign Voyages, whether for Beer or for Water, shall be new, to prevent any occasion of buying Cask Abroad.
"
rn-1790-00173," XII. Though all Warrants for Victualling do properly issue from the Lord High Admiral, or Lord's Commissioners of the Admiralty; yet, if any of His Majesty's ships shall happen to come into Port in Want of Provisions, the Warrant of a Commander in Chief shall be sufficient to the Agent, or other Instrument of the Victualling, to supply the Quanity wanted ; or in urgent Cases, where delay may be hurtful, the Warrant of the Captain of the ship shall be of equal Effect.
"
rn-1790-00174," XIII. When any Vessels come on Board with Provisions, Victualling or other stores, they are not to be suffered to loiter by the ship's side, but forthwith to be unladen and sent away; nor shall the Captain of one ship stop a Vessel that is consigned to another ship, or take out any Part of her Lading. 
"
rn-1790-00175," XIV. All supplies of Provisions are to be put on Board the ships without any Charge to the Purser for Ligherage, Porterage, or otherwise, and with all the Dispatch possible; and the Masters of the Vessels, or Lighters, by whom the Provisions are sent, shall see the same put into the slings or Tackles of the ship they are consigned to, by careful Men belonging to the ship ; and shall likewise deliver to the Captain a perfect Bill of Lading, under the Hand of the Victualling Officer, that he may see if the Whole is brought on Board. 
"
rn-1790-00176," XV. If any Provisions slip out of the slings, or are otherwise damaged or lost by Malice or Carelessness of the ship's Company, the Captain is to charge the Value against the Wages of the Offender, and give a Certificate to the Purser, expressing how the same happened, with the Name of the Offender, and the sum charged against him, that the Purser may be allowed it on his Accounts. 
"
rn-1790-00177," XVI. No Provisions sent off for the supply of His Majesty's ships, shall be refused on Pretence of their being old and unfit for keeping, unless there shall be reasonable Ground to object against any such Provisions; and, in that Case, the Captain or Commanding Officer shall first cause the same to be surveyed by the proper Officers, who are faithfully to report to him, under their Hands, the Condition thereof; and, if the said Provisions shall then appear to be unfit for the Use of the ship, he is to return them to the Officer of the Victualling who sent them off, together with the original survey for his justification.
"
rn-1790-00178," XVII. The Captain is frequently to order the proper Officers to inspect into the Condition of the Provisions especially in Foreign Voyages, and if the Bread proves damp, to have it aired upon the Quarter Deck or Poop ; and also to examine the Flesh Cask ; and if any Pickle be leaked out, to have new made and put in, and the Cask made tight and secured.
"
rn-1790-00179," XVIII. If the Purser of a ship shall have supplied the Purser of another ship at sea with Provisions, by Order in Writing from his Captain, the Receipt of the Purser who received the Provisions, together with the Captain's Order, shall be sufficient Warrant to the Agent or other Instrument of the Victualling, at the next Port the ship shall put into, to supply him with the like Quantity, upon producing the said Order and Receipt. 
"
rn-1790-00180," XIX. When any of His Majesty's ships shall come into Port, either at Home or Abroad, where there is an Officer of the Victualling, they shall be supplied Two Days in the Week with fresh Beef or Mutton, one Day in lieu of salt Beef, and the other in lieu of salt Pork, when it can be conveniently done, for which the Captains are to send their Boats. And it is to be observed, that Three Pounds of Mutton are to be accounted equal to a Four Pound Piece of Beef, or to a Two Pound Piece of Pork with Pease.
"
rn-1790-00181," XX. When any Prizes shall be taken from an Enemy in Foreign Parts, and it shall be judged necessary by the Commander in Chief to supply the Wants of His Majesty's ships out of their Provisions, the same shall be first regularly surveyed, and such Quantities thereof, as shall be found good in their Kind, may be issued to the Pursers, and they be charged therewith. But no Part thereof shall be served out to the Men, whilst any of His Majesty's Provisions of the same species are remaining, nor shall any Allowance be made for the Damage that may accrue to them in keeping. And, as to their Value, the same Price shall be paid as is allowed to Pursers who have Credit upon the Balance of their Accounts.  
"
rn-1790-00182," Of the Payment of short-Allowance Money. 
"
rn-1790-00183," I.

"
rn-1790-00184," II. But, if the ship is in Foreign Parts, where there is no Agent Victualler, the Captain shall cause the said Lists to be made out every Three Months, and duly examined and signed ; and, after casting the sums due to those only who are then belonging to the ship, into Money, he is to present the said Lists to the Commander in Chief, or senior Captain, who shall give his Warrant to the Purser to take up so much Money as Commander in Chief to and comptroll the Payment. as the Total shall amount to, upon the best Exchange, and draw Bills upon the commissioners of the Victualling for the same.

But if the ship sails before the Examination can be taken, he is not to issue any inferior Goods to the Men, but to return them to the Contractor, or his Agent, when he comes into Port, unless there shall be an extraordinary Want of them; in which Case the said Officers, are to rate them according to their best skill and Judgment, as well in Right to the slopseller as to the Men, and to make Abatements in the Price, proportionable to what they are inferior to the Patterns. 
"
rn-1790-00193," II. If any seamen shall be brought on Board to serve His Majesty in Time of Press, and he shall be destitute of Necessaries, the Captain may order him immediately to be supplied with Cloaths or Bedding not exceeding one Month's Pay in Value.

"
rn-1790-00204," XIII. Upon the Death or Removal of a Purser, a survey is to be taken, by the same Officers who survey the Provisions and stores, of the slops, Dead Mens Cloaths, and Bedding, that remained in his Hands, which are to be delivered over to the fucceeding Purser by Inventory, in which are to be distinguished such as are damaged and unserviceable, and a Copy entered in the slop - Book, signed by the Officers employed in the survey.

And on those occasions, the eldest Commander of a Convoy shall command in the first Post ; the next eldest Commander of a Convoy, in the second Post ; and so on ; to the Number of Convoys that may happen to sail together. Nor is any private Captain in Company, though elder than some of the Commanders of a Convoy, to break in upon this Disposition, or think themselves injured thereby, it not being intended to his Prejudice, but to preserve Order and good Government amongst the several Convoys, while they are together. 
"

"
rn-1790-00460," APPENDIX. His Majesty's Orders relating to the Respects to be paid to Flag Officers and Commodores, from the Troops in Forts and Garrisons. 
"
rn-1790-00461," WHEREAS We have thought fit to order, that the several Admirals of Our Fleet shall have, upon all occasions, the same Respects paid to them from Our Troops when they come into any of Our Forts and Garrisons where Our Forces are, as the Respective Generals of Our Army, have paid them from Our Forces ; Our Will and Pleasure therefore is, that the following Rules be well observed, and put in Execution.

"
rn-1790-00466,"Additional REGULATIONs and INsTRUCTIONs relating to His Majesty's service at sea. ARTICLE I. WHEREAs by the Fifty-ninth Article of the General printed Instructions, the Captains of His Majesty's ships are permitted, when they are removed by commission from one ship into another, to carry along with them the following Number of Men, including their own servants, viz. Rate. From a ift 2d 3d 4th 5th - Men. 80 65 50 40 his own him. 20 6th 10 Bb 2 But the same having been attended with Inconveniencies and Prejudice to the service, every Commander is hereby required, when a Press shall be on Foot, never to remove with him from one ship to another any Number of Men whatsoever, his own servants excepted, without a written Order for so doing from the Admiralty or the Commander in Chief at the Port where the ship may be.
"
rn-1790-00467,"II. There being reason to believe , that, in Times of pressing, the Captains of some of His Majesty's ships have taken an unjustifiable Liberty of discharging Men whom they did not like , or sending them on shore in their Boats, thereby giving them an Opportunity of deserting; every Commander of His Majesty's ships and Vessels is hereby strictly charged and required (when a Press shall be on Foot) not to presume to discharge any Man, on any Account whatsoever, without an Order from this Board, or a Flag Officer ; and to avoid giving Opportunities for Desertion, he is strictly charged never to send or employ any Men on shore (if it can possibly be avoided) or send any in Merchant ships in Lieu of Prest Men, or to give Leave of Absence to any, unless they are Trust-worthy, and may be depended upon for their Return ; but to take Care to keep them strictly to their Duty, unless there shall be an absolute Necessity, by Reason of sickness, to send them to Hospitals for Cure ; and, in that Case, to take as much Care as possible may be, that they be sent on shore in such Manner, as not to give them Opportunity to desert, and that they be brought on Board again as soon as recovered of their sickness
"
rn-1790-00468,"III. There being great Reason to believe that it is a frequent Practice for Commanders of His Majesty's ships to send Men to Hospitals or sick Quarters for slight Ailments or Hurts, which might very well be taken Care of and cured on Board the ships to which they belong: And whereas such Proceeding is not only burthensome to the Public, by occasioning a great additional Expence while the Men are under Cure, but is attended with a still much worse consequence to the service, by the Loss of many Men, who make use of the Opportunity thereby afforded them to desert : For Remedy of thefe Evils, every Commander of His Majesty's ships and Vessels is hereby strictly enjoined never to send any Men to an Hospital or sick Quarters, unless their distempers or Hurts are such, or the Number of sick and Hurt so great, that they cannot be taken due Care of on Board, which the surgeon of the ship is to certify, under his Hand, before any Man whatever is sent to such Hospital or Quarters : And in Order to a due Observance hereof, we do farther direct, that when any Men are sent sick on shore, the Physician and surgeon of the Hospital do forthwith examine them; and if they find any who might have been taken due Care of, and probably cured in a little Time on Board their ships, and therefore ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing Injunction, to have been sent on shore, they are to certify the same to the Commanding Officer at the Port, who is immediately to cause them to be returned to their ships, and to transmit the Certificate from the Physician and surgeon to the Navy-Board, who are thereupon to cause Twenty shillings for each Man so improperly sent on shore, to be charged against the Wages of the surgeon of the ship from which they were sent, and to be abated therefrom. And whenever the Hospitals or sick Quarters are visited by a commissioner for sick and Hurt, who is a Physician or surgeon, if he finds any persons entertained therein , who ought not, agreeable to the aforegoing Regulation, to have been received , the commissioners for sick and Hurt are to cause the surgeon and the Agent at the Hospital or sick Quarters to be mulcted Twenty shillings each for every Man so entertained. 
"
rn-1790-00469,"IV. He is strictly enjoined punctually to comply with the latter Part of the Eighteenth Article of the General printed Instructions, directing, (if the ship is in Great Britain or Ireland) a Monthly Account of Men, discharged to be sent to the Admiralty Office ; and in Addition thereto, he is, whenever the ship puts into any Port of Great Britain or Ireland from a Cruize, to send a like Account of Men discharged, between the Time the last Account ended, and the Time of so putting into Port. He is also strictly to comply with the sixteenth Article of the said Instructions, by sending constant Accounts to the secretary of the Admiralty, of Men who desert, at the Times such Desertions happen ; and, moreover, whenever he sends an Account of Men discharged as above directed , he is strictly enjoined to transmit an Account of Men who have deserted within the same Period of Time that the Account of discharged Men includes, and to note against them the several Particulars prescribed in the Fifteenth Article of the said Instructions. He is also further strictly directed , when he sends the aforementioned Accounts to transmit with them a third Account, containing the Names and Qualities of all the Men who have died within the same Periods of Time : And if he shall have supernumeraries on Board, he is to distinguish in each Account which of the Men were Part of his Complement, and which were supernumeraries.
"
rn-1790-00470,"V. Great Inconvenience having arisen to the service, and also great Discouragement to scamen serving in His Majesty's ships, from Captains sometimes discharging Men without Tickets, every Commander is hereby enjoined to a very strict and punctual Compliance with the seventeenth Article of the General printed Instructions, (under the Head of the Captain or Commander) in relation to making out Tickets for every person who shall be discharged ; and, if the Party shall be dead or absent, the Commander is strictly charged to transmit his Ticket immediately, or by the very first Opportunity, to the Navy- Board. And whenever any Ticket is made out, he is strictly charged to see that all Deductions, of any Kind whatsoever, that ought to be made from the Wages of the Party, be carefully set off, upon Pain of making good the Value of any failure therein.
"
rn-1790-00471,"VI. When any Men borne for Wages shall be discharged from one ship or Vessel to another, the Captain of the ship or Vessel from which they shall be discharged, is to be particularly careful to send immediately to the Navy-Board proper Pay- Lists for such Men, in order that they may be paid the Wages due to them as soon as possible after their being so discharged. 
"
rn-1790-00472,"VII. Whereas it generally happens, that when any of His Majesty's ships proceed to sea, they leave Men at an Hospital or sick Quarters, and some of those Men are afterwards discharged from thence unserviceable ; or, (as is sometimes the Case) being discharged from the Hospital or sick Quarters into ships near at Hand, they are in a short Time turned on shore as unfit for service : And whereas Men, under either circumstance, are reduced to great Distress and Misery for Want of their Wages, which, by the present Regulations, cannot be paid, because they have not the usual Tickets of discharge ; in order to give the poor Men, Relief herein, the Navy- Board are to cause printed Tickets, in the Form, ( Pages 230, 231 , ) to be issued to the several Commanders of His Majesty's ships and Vessels who are hereby strictly charged to take Care timely to apply for the same, and always to have a sufficient Number of the said Tickets by them ; and whenever any Man, whether seamen or Marine, is sent to an Hospital or sick Quarters from any ship or Vessel of His Majesty's, her Commander is never to fail sending one of the said Tickets with him to the Agent for sick and Hurt, and to be particularly careful, that the Respective Columns be duly filled up, because, if the Man shall be discharged unserviceable from the Hospital or sick Quarters, or put on Board any other ship than that from which he was sent, the Agent is to transmit the said Ticket, together with the customary Ticket of Discharge from the Hospital, to the commissioner of the Navy at the Port, or to the Navy-Board, and from them a proper Ticket is to be forthwith made out, and the Wages paid; or if the Man shall be put on Board any other ship besides that from which he was sent to the Hospital or Quarters, and shall be turned on shore unserviceable before he gets back to his proper ship, a Ticket is to be made out, and his Wages paid as aforesaid, as soon as such Case happens : As therefore the ascertaining the Wages due to the Man, will depend upon the Accuracy in filling up the Ticket above directed to be sent with him to the Agent for sick and Hurt, the Commanders of His Majesty's ships and Vessels are, respectively to be responsible for the consequence of any failure therein.

"
usn-1775-00004,"The Commanders of the ships of the thirteen United Colonies, are to take care that divine service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon preached on Sundays, unless bad Weather or other extraordinary accidents prevent it.
"
usn-1775-00005,"If any shall be heard to swear, curse, or blaspheme the name of God, the Commander is strictly enjoined to punish them for every offence, by causing them to wear a wooden collar, or some other shameful badge of distinction, for so long time as he shall judge proper. If he be a commissioned officer, he shall forfeit one shilling for each offence, and a warrant or inferior officer six pence. He who is guilty of drunkenness, if a seaman, shall be put in irons until he is sober, but if an officer, he shall forfeit two days' pay.
"
usn-1775-00006,"No Commander shall inflict any punishment upon a seaman beyond twelve lashes upon his bare back, with a cat of nine tails; if the fault shall deserve a greater punishment, he is to apply to the Commander in chief of the Navy, in order to the trying of him by a court martial, and in the mean time, he may put him under confinement.
"
usn-1775-00007,"The Commander is never by his own authority to discharge a commission or warrant officer, nor to punish or strike him, but he may suspend or confine them, and when he comes in the way of a Commander in Chief, apply to him for holding a court martial.
"
usn-1775-00008,"The Officer who commands by accident of the Captain's or commander's absence (unless he be absent for a time by leave) shall not order any correction, but confinement, and upon the captain's return on board, he shall then give an account of his reasons for so doing.
"
usn-1775-00009,"The Captain is to cause the articles of war to be hung up in some public places of the ship, and read to the ship's company once a month.
